# Project Title – OfferZone: Local Retailer Deal Discovery Platform  


## Description  
OfferZone is a digital platform designed to connect local retailers with consumers by showcasing offline  offers. It enables retailers to register business accounts, publish deals, and reach nearby shoppers, while consumers can explore location-based discounts and enjoy both local and major online festival sales. The platform focuses on delivering a user-friendly interface that fosters trust and strong connections between retailers and customers. 

## Problem Statement
In today’s digital era, consumers are highly informed about online deals, but offline shopping experiences often lack visibility of local offers. Local retailers struggle to reach nearby customers effectively, while consumers miss out on discounts and promotions available in their own neighborhoods.

Existing platforms primarily focus on online marketplaces, leaving a gap for local, offline-centric deal discovery. Retailers need a simple way to showcase their offers digitally without heavy technical or marketing investments, and consumers need a reliable platform to find the best nearby deals quickly.

## The Gap

Consumers want the assurance of offline shopping—where they can touch, feel, and instantly own the product—combined with the convenience and visibility of digital offers. Retailers need a platform that gives them a voice in the digital space without losing their local identity and personal customer relationships.


## Our Vision with OfferZone

 - OfferZone bridges this gap by:
 - Helping retailers digitally showcase in-store offers to nearby customers.
 - Allowing consumers to enjoy offline shopping experiences with better visibility of discounts in their area.
 - Building a trust-driven ecosystem where great local deals meet genuine offline shopping satisfaction.


 

## Backend  

- Handles business logic and communicates with a NoSQL database.  
- Exposes REST APIs for user, retailer, and offer management.  
- Supports event-driven communication for notifications and alerts.  
- Implements transactional outbox for reliable domain event publishing.  
- Provides scalability with caching, message queues, and geospatial queries.  


## Core Features  

### Consumer
