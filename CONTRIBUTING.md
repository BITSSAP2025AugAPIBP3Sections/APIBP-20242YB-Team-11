# Contributing to OfferZone

Thanks for your interest in contributing to OfferZone! This document explains how to propose changes, report issues, and submit pull requests so maintainers can review and merge quickly.

## Before you begin

- Check existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicates.
- If you plan a large feature, open an issue first to discuss design and scope.

## Quick workflow

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`.
3. Make changes in a focused commit series.
4. Run tests / linters (if present) and ensure everything passes.
5. Push the branch to your fork and open a Pull Request against `main`.

## Branching & Commit Guidelines

- Branch names: `feat/<short>`, `fix/<short>`, `chore/<short>`, `docs/<short>`.
- Commit messages: use imperative present tense, e.g. `Add product search endpoint`.
- Squash or rebase as appropriate; keep history readable.

## Creating a Good Pull Request

Include the following in your PR description:

- **Summary**: what the change does and why.
- **Related issue**: reference with `#<issue-number>` or explain if none.
- **Testing**: how this was tested (manual steps or automated tests).
- **Notes**: any migration steps, breaking changes, or TODOs.

Checklist before requesting review:

- [ ] Changes are limited in scope and focused.
- [ ] Linting and formatting applied (if configured).
- [ ] Tests added or existing tests updated to cover changes.
- [ ] Documentation updated (`README.md`, `swagger.yaml`) if API changed.

## Coding Standards

- Follow existing code style in the repository.
- Prefer clear, descriptive names for variables and functions.
- Avoid large refactors in the same PR as feature additions.

## Reporting Issues

- Use the issue templates to report bugs or request features.
- Provide steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and environment details.

## Reviewing & CI

Pull Requests will be reviewed by maintainers. If CI is configured, please ensure it passes before requesting final review.

## Getting Help

- Ask questions on the issue before spending too much time implementing.
- For project-specific or urgent questions, see `SUPPORT.md` for contact options.

Thank you for contributing — every improvement helps!
