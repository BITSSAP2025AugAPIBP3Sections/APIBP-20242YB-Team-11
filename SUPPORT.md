 # Support

If you need help using OfferZone or want to discuss usage, please use one of the following channels:

- **Issues:** Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests (non-sensitive).
- **Discussions:** (If enabled) use GitHub Discussions for broader questions and community conversation.
- **Email / Commercial Support:** For private questions or commercial support, contact the maintainers listed in `MAINTAINERS.md` or a support address if provided.

Response expectations

- Maintainers will triage new issues within 3–5 business days when possible.
- For urgent or security-sensitive matters, follow the process in `SECURITY.md`.

How to ask for help

- Provide the version/commit of OfferZone you are using and environment details (Node and MongoDB versions).
- Include steps to reproduce and relevant logs or error messages.

If you want, I can add a `SUPPORT.md` section linking to a Slack/Discord/Matrix channel if you provide an invite URL or a support email address to include.
