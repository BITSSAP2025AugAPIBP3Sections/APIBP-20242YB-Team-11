# Security Policy

We take security seriously. If you discover a potential security vulnerability, please follow these responsible disclosure steps so we can address it before it is publicly disclosed.

Reporting process

1. Do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.
2. Send a detailed email to the security contact: `security@offerzone.example` (placeholder). Include:
   - A concise summary of the vulnerability
   - Step-by-step reproduction steps and proof-of-concept (if safe to share)
   - Affected versions / components
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigations
3. Allow maintainers reasonable time to respond and coordinate a fix.

Response & timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and provide a plan and estimated timeline.
- We will coordinate disclosure with the reporter and maintainers once a fix is available.

Important: Replace the placeholder address `security@offerzone.example` with a real email before publishing this repository. If you prefer, maintainers can use GitHub's private security advisories instead of email.

If the issue is critical and affects user data in production, mark it clearly in the report and escalate via the contacts listed in `MAINTAINERS.md`.
